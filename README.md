Elder Social Lite
To develop an intuitive interface for elderly users, we created multiple Interface  and digital wireframes outlining the layout of the Elder Social Lite application. The key components included:
# Home Screen: Large, high-contrast icons for easy navigation.
# Chat Interface: Simple message layout with large font sizes and intuitive placement of buttons.
# Call Interface: One-tap audio and video call buttons.
# Settings Menu: Accessible customization options (font size, color theme, and profile settings).
# User Profile & Contacts: Simple contact list with auto-generated avatars.
